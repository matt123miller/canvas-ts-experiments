Higher level goals: 
    ☐ Eventually allow a user to choose shapes to render

Random tidbits:
    ☐ Allow a user to create a randomly shaped n-sided polygon
        - I know I did this in Swift years ago, it must be locked in my brain somewhere.
        ✔ Create a uniform n-sided polygon @done(20-04-28 18:23)

Configuration system:
    ☐ User selects how many shapes to draw
    ☐ Configurable background pattern
    ☐ Export to image?
    ✔ Switch between simple and complex renderers @done(20-04-28 18:18)
    ☐ All optons should live update the canvas

Hexagons:
    ✔ pointy vs flat hexagons? @done(20-04-28 15:41)
        ✔ I'll go with flat for now @done(20-04-28 18:23)
    ☐ User input for rows and columns
